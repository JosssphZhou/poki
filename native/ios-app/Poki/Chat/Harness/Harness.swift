// The chat's prompt and tools are the Mac Poki Agent's, copied from this repository at main 729c77e:
// - agent-system.md is agent/prompts/system.md (the same text as agent/prompts/pi-app.md, which
//   agent/task-runner.mjs loads), except two sentences that named tools the app lacks: a locked phone
//   is the owner's to unlock and a password prompt is handed to them, and a purchase is a plain tap;
//   and, for ESP-465, the Return sentence names the type answer's read-back as the check before
//   Return, an action's check lines (the send check after Return) count as evidence, and finish_task
//   comes in the reply right after the observation that verifies the result; and the purchase sentence
//   is replaced by one on choosing within the owner's request (Poki's rules decide what asks), and the
//   tool-error sentence says a declined or unanswered approval is the owner's decision;
// - the instructions put PokiCore's own MCP instructions first, as task-runner.mjs puts the MCP server's
//   instructions first;
// - look, do and status are PokiCore's tools with their MCP descriptions;
// - report_plan and finish_task are task-runner.mjs's harness tools (#startModel), descriptions and
//   schemas unchanged.
// Not copied, because the app has none of their tools: agent/prompts/call-draft.md and
// agent/skills/iphone-unlock/SKILL.md, unlock_device and handle_alert.
